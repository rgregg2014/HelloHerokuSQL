## Basic Hello Heroku Deployment (SQL)

This is a basic deployment for Heroku to get started. This uses Express with Handlebars to get a "Coming Soon" landing page up. It is a good place to begin, so everyone is in agreement on the file and folder structure. You will also be able to have a link available right away to submit in BCS.
